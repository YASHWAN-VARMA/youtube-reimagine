# A User-Controlled, Distraction-Free YouTube

## About
A concept demo that reimagines YouTube around **user intent**, instead of pure engagement.

## Why?
Users open YouTube with a goal:
- Learn a topic
- Watch one video
- Study briefly

But the product quickly pulls them into Shorts and endless recommendations.

## What Changed
### Learn Mode
- Shorts disabled by default
- Educational recommendations
- Searchable Saved videos

### Relax Mode
- Entertainment content (anime, games)
- Shorts enabled
- Full Saved library

## Design Principles
- Remove distractions instead of adding warnings
- Defaults matter more than settings
- Respect user intent

## Stack
HTML · CSS · JavaScript (no backend)

## Status
Demo prototype for product reimagination.
